# Classification_Algorithm_Implementations_R
Implement multiple classifier algorithms in R to predict Airbnb listings receiving highest customer ratings and (if possible) identify/rank predictors of customer satisfaction.

Used feature engineering, sentiment analysis, data visualization/exploratory analysis, and multiple classifier algorithms to identify/rank predictors of customer satisfaction and predict Airbnb listings receiving highest customer ratings. Random Forest was best performer with accuracy = 0.71, sensitivity = 0.77, specificity = 0.67.

Final results also available as a report (see "PredictiveModelsOfCustomerSatisfaction_Report.docx").
